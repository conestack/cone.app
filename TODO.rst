- Upgrade pyramid to 2.0 for python 3.12 and higher. This is necessary because pyramid 1.9.4
  depends on the imp module, which has been removed since python 3.12.
- Main menu display children.
- Custom root node in example.
- Referencebrowser widget.
- Treibstoff styles.
- Yafowil bootstrap 5 styles.
- Yafowil addon widgets.
- SCSS splitting.
- Reduce CSS class noise and add some custom rules to SCSS files.
- Check if we can retrieve Bootstrap sources other than including in this repo
  for development.
